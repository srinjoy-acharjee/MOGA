Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) for Optimization

Overview
Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) is a powerful optimization technique that addresses problems with multiple conflicting objectives. It aims to find a set of solutions, known as the Pareto front, where no solution dominates another in all objectives, offering a range of trade-offs between conflicting goals.


Features
Efficiently handles optimization problems with multiple conflicting objectives.
Generates a diverse set of solutions along the Pareto front, allowing decision-makers to explore trade-offs.
Incorporates genetic operators like selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve solutions over generations.
Provides flexibility in problem representation, allowing for customization based on specific problem domains.
Usage
Problem Definition: Define the optimization problem with multiple objectives, along with their respective constraints.
Initialization: Initialize a population of candidate solutions using random or heuristic methods.
Evaluation: Evaluate the fitness of each candidate solution based on multiple objectives.
Evolutionary Process: Apply genetic operators (selection, crossover, mutation) to evolve the population over multiple generations.
Termination: Determine stopping criteria, such as a maximum number of generations or convergence criteria.
Result Analysis: Analyze the Pareto front to identify trade-offs and select appropriate solutions based on decision-maker preferences.
Integration with Custom Databases



To use MOGA with your own collected database:

Data Preparation: Organize your data into appropriate formats for input to the optimization problem.
Objective Functions: Define objective functions that capture the goals of your optimization problem, considering the characteristics of your dataset.
Constraint Handling: Specify any constraints or limitations on the optimization problem, ensuring feasibility in real-world applications.
Implementation: Integrate MOGA with your dataset and problem specifications, utilizing libraries or frameworks that support multi-objective optimization.
Validation: Validate the performance of MOGA using your dataset, comparing obtained solutions with domain-specific expectations or benchmarks.

Note: except .classpath and .project make sure every file is in 'SRC' folder


Example :

# Example Python code for using MOGA with a custom dataset
from Moga import MultiObjectiveGeneticAlgorithm

# Define objective functions and constraints
def objective_1(solution):
    pass

def objective_2(solution):
    pass

def constraints(solution):
    pass

# Initialize MOGA with custom parameters
moga = MultiObjectiveGeneticAlgorithm(objective_functions=[objective_1, objective_2],
                                      constraints=constraints,
                                      population_size=100,
                                      generations=1000)

# Run MOGA with the custom dataset
solutions = moga.run()
